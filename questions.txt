Open main1.py. Before running it, what do you expect this program to do? 

Not sure what the first few lines do but the bottom two will print Greetings and store my favorite color as an input.

Now right click on the window and select “Run Python File in Terminal”. Click in the bottom panel, and answer the question. Describe what happened. 

The file printed what I had previously said along with the location of Python and the repository.

What do you think the program did with what you typed?

The program stored my input of my favorite color.

Open main2.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main1.py. 

The program now turns the input into a variable called color and it prints it out.

What do you think the color = input() will do? 

It makes whatever is in the input() into the variable color.

Run the program in the terminal and answer the question. Did the program do what you expected?

The program did indeed do what was expected.

Open main3.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main2.py. 

There is an if/else statement which responds to the variable color's value.

What is happening on lines 11–14? 

An if/else statement 

Why are lines 12 and 14 indented? 



Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you don’t capitalize Red? 

What does this tell you about "color"?



Open main4.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main2.py. 

What problem is this trying to solve? 

Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you use some other capitalization scheme (i.e., “RED” or “reD“)?



Open main5.py. What do you expect line 11 to do? 

What problem is it trying to solve? 

Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you add spaces before or after the word (i.e., “  RED  “ or “ red”)?



Open main6.py. How is line 11 different than main5.py? 

What would you guess .strip() is doing? 

Run the program and answer the question. Is there another way of writing “red” that will break this logic?



Open main7.py. Before running this program, how do you expect this to be different than main6.py? 

What is the purpose of line 11? 

Run the program and answer the question.



Open main8.py. What is the purpose of line 11? 

Why are lines 12–19 indented? 

Run the program. What would happen if line 12 were moved before line 11 (and no longer indented)? 

Make that change and run the program again. To end any Python program, you can type ctrl-c.



Open main9.py. What is happening on line 12? 

What is the purpose of “count”? 

What is happening on line 22? 

Run the program.
